# Image Classifier Project

**The dataset is comprised of photos of dogs and cats provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of 3 million manually annotated photos. The dataset was developed as a partnership between Petfinder.com and Microsoft.**

**The dataset was originally used as a CAPTCHA, that is, a task that it is believed a human finds trivial, but cannot be solved by a machine, used on websites to distinguish between human users and bots. The task was referred to as "Asirra". When "Asirra" was presented, it was mentioned 'that user studies indicate it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Barring a major advance in machine vision, we expect computers will have no better than a 1/54,000 chance of solving it'.**

**At the time that the competition was posted, the state-of-the-art result was achieved with an SVM and described in a 2007 paper with the title “Machine Learning Attacks Against the Asirra CAPTCHA” (PDF) that achieved 80% classification accuracy. It was this paper that demonstrated that the task was no longer a suitable task for a CAPTCHA soon after the task was proposed.**

**The dataset is straightforward to understand and small enough to fit into memory and get started with computer vision and convolutional neural networks.**
